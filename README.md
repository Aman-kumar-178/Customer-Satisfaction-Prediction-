# 😊 Customer Satisfaction Prediction  

## 📖 Overview  
The **Customer Satisfaction Prediction** project aims to analyze and predict how satisfied customers are based on their feedback, demographic data, and behavioral patterns.  
By leveraging **Machine Learning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, this project helps businesses understand key drivers of customer satisfaction and take proactive steps to improve service quality.

The project includes **data cleaning**, **visualization**, **feature engineering**, and **model building** using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Seaborn**.  
The final trained model is exported as a `.pkl` file for future deployment or dashboard integration.

## 🧠 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess customer data for analysis.  
- Explore the data through statistical summaries and visualizations.  
- Identify key features affecting customer satisfaction.  
- Build and evaluate ML models to predict satisfaction levels.  
- Export the final model for deployment and reuse.

## 📂 Dataset Information  
- **Dataset Name:** Customer Satisfaction Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle / Custom Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/) *(Add your actual link)*  
- **Attributes Include:**  
  - `Age`, `Gender`, `Income`, `Service_Quality`, `Product_Quality`, `Support_Response_Time`,  
    `Overall_Satisfaction`, `Purchase_Frequency`, `Feedback_Score`, etc.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas` – data manipulation and preprocessing  
  - `numpy` – numerical operations  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – model training and evaluation  
  - `pickle` – model serialization  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Customer satisfaction is strongly influenced by **product quality**, **service quality**, and **response time**.  
- **Older customers** and **loyal buyers** tend to report higher satisfaction.  
- Negative feedback correlates with **delayed responses** and **low-quality services**.  
- Business units with **personalized service** achieve better ratings.

## 🚀 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Collection & Loading** – Import dataset into Pandas DataFrame.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify key relationships and patterns.  
4. **Feature Engineering** – Create derived features (e.g., satisfaction ratio, average rating).  
5. **Model Training** – Apply ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.  
6. **Model Evaluation** – Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
7. **Model Deployment** – Save trained model as `.pkl` for real-world use.
